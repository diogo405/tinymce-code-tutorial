Ideas for more exercises:

Millie suggested:
Basic “how to set up custom UI” exercises. We do it occasionally for actual development, but we do it a lot for
support cases, creating demos, etc. And I think it would be a good introduction to the wider concepts of Alloy and such.
E.g. custom toolbar buttons are in https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/ui-components/toolbarbuttons/ and
https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/ui-components/typesoftoolbarbuttons/. And menu items are at
https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/ui-components/menuitems/
